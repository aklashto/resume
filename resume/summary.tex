\begin{cvparagraph}

I am a graduate student at the University of Waterloo and I have lived in Guelph for five years.
Professionally, I am trained in computer engineering so I can bring some tech literacy to the committee.
I have had a lifelong interest in the way cities and transportation are laid out.
I also understand that there are some significant changes we must make to reduce our carbon emissions and combat climate change, including reducing car dependence, championing higher density housing, and improving public and active transportation.
I feel that I have some basic knowledge of these ideas and goals and would like to contribute to their implementation within the community.
